About my website

    I build my original website using the WIX drag-and-drop technology. Although, I never wanted to use WIX, I didn't (and still don't) possess the necessary skills to build it from scratch. Thanks to Per Scholas, that's no longer the case, and as I learn, I will continue to add functionality. 
    
    Human Management Systems that resides on the WIX server has never been published to the public. 
    
    While I did manually format each of the pages and their elements for this project, I used the style I painstakingly created. In addition, I used (my story) on the About page which has also been saved on the cloud and various external disks.

    I am including this link to my unpublished site on WIX:
